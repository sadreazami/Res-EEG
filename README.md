# Res-EEG
Residual network based RCSP EEG signal classification in MI-BCI

We propose a task recognition in MI-BCI using regularized common spatial patterns and residual network. A time-dependent regularized csp is obtained and projected onto an image representation. The image is used as input to residual network or convolutional neural network for further automatic featiure extraction and classification.
